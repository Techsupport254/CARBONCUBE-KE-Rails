# Legal Governance Handbook

## 1. Corporate Structure & Foundation

A strong legal foundation prevents existential risks.

### Entity & Registration
*   **Establishment**: Ensure the company is correctly incorporated (e.g., C-Corp, LLC) in the appropriate jurisdiction (e.g., Delaware).
*   **Registered Agent**: Maintain an active registered agent for receiving legal documents.
*   **EIN**: Secure Employer Identification Number for tax purposes.

### Founder & Equity Agreements
*   **Founder Stock Purchase Agreements**: Define ownership percentages, vesting schedules, and acceleration clauses.
*   **Cap Table Management**: Maintain an accurate Capitalization Table (using tools like Carta or Pulley) tracking all equity issuance, options, and warrants.
*   **83(b) Elections**: Ensure founders file within 30 days of stock purchase to optimize tax treatment.

## 2. Intellectual Property (IP) Protection

For a tech company, IP is the primary asset.

### Protection Strategy
*   **Proprietary Information**: Identify what constitutes a trade secret vs. patentable invention.
*   **Trademarks**: File for company name and product logos to protect brand identity.
*   **Patents**: Evaluate unique technical innovations for potential patent filing.

### Assignment Agreements (Crucial)
*   **PIIA (Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment)**: **Every** employee and contractor MUST sign this. It ensures the company owns the IP they create, not the individual.
    *   *Risk*: Without this, a developer could legally claim ownership of the code they wrote.

### Confidentiality
*   **NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements)**: Use mutual or one-way NDAs when sharing sensitive info with partners, vendors, or potential hires.

## 3. Board of Directors & Governance

### Composition & Roles
*   **Fiduciary Duties**: Directors have a duty of care and loyalty to the company and shareholders, not just the founders.
*   **Board Structure**: define the number of seats (e.g., Common Stock seat, Investor seat, Independent seat).

### Board Meetings
*   **Frequency**: Establish a regular meeting schedule (e.g., quarterly).
*   **Minutes**: Keep formal minutes of all board meetings. This is a legal requirement and critical during due diligence for fundraising or acquisition.
*   **Consent**: Use written consents for actions taken without a meeting.

## 4. Compliance Checklist

### Data Privacy & Security
*   **GDPR (Europe)** & **CCPA/CPRA (California)**:
    *   Implement user consent flows for data collection.
    *   Provide "Right to be Forgotten" and data portability mechanisms.
    *   Update Privacy Policy to transparently disclose data practices.
*   **Security Standards**: Aim for **SOC 2** or **ISO 27001** readiness early. Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

### Employment & HR
*   **Employee Handbook**: Create policies for remote work, code of conduct, anti-harassment, and benefits.
*   **Contractors vs. Employees**: Properly classify workers to avoid severe tax penalties and legal lawsuits.
*   **EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity)**: Adhere to non-discrimination laws in hiring.

### Risk Management
*   **Insurance**:
    *   **D&O (Directors & Officers)**: Protects board members from personal liability.
    *   **E&O (Errors & Omissions)**: Liability for product failures.
    *   **Cyber Liability**: Protection against data breaches.
*   **Audits**: Conduct annual internal legal and financial audits.

## 5. Document Management
*   **Data Room**: Maintain a "due diligence ready" data room containing up-to-date versions of all the above documents.
